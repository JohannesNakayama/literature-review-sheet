# Comprehensive Literature Review Sheet

When reviewing literature / related work for a scientific paper, organizing one's notes on the different readings can be a chore. This project provides an RMarkdown template for comprehensive literature reviews to help scientist organize their readings in a comprehensive and tidy way.

The questions in the template are adopted from William G. Griswold's great guide on how to read an engineering paper (http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/CSE210/howtoread.html). Feel free to customize them to fit your needs when reviewing related work. 

NOTE: You should think of a convention for naming your review documents so that you can query them later. Here is a suggestion:

<first author's last name>_<year>_<title>
