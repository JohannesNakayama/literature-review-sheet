<!--

When reviewing literature for a scientific paper, it is necessary to have a standardized way of handling and reviewing it. This a template for a comprehensive literature review that you can use for your own purposes. The questions below are adopted from William G. Griswold's great guide on how to read an engineering paper (http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/CSE210/howtoread.html). 

NOTE: You should think of a convention for naming your review documents so that you can query them later. Here is a suggestion:

<first author's last name>_<year>_<title>

--> 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)

# execute if you want to generate bibtex from doi ----
# RefManageR::GetBibEntryWithDOI(doi = "", temp.file = "tmp.bib", delete.file = TRUE)

```

```{bibtex}

# put bibtex entry here ----

 

```
