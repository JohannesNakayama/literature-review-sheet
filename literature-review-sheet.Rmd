When reviewing literature / related work for a scientific paper, organizing one's notes on the different readings can be a chore. This project provides an RMarkdown template for comprehensive literature reviews to help scientist organize their readings in a comprehensive and tidy way. 

The questions below are adopted from William G. Griswold's great guide on how to read an engineering paper (http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/CSE210/howtoread.html). 

NOTE: You should think of a convention for naming your review documents so that you can query them later. Here is a suggestion:

<first author's last name>_<year>_<title>

--> 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)

library(RefManageR)

# execute if you want to generate bibtex from doi ----
# GetBibEntryWithDOI(doi = "", temp.file = "tmp.bib", delete.file = TRUE)

```

```{bibtex}

# put bibtex entry here ----
